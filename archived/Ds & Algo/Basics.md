# Datastructures And Algorithms

### Job applications

- Referrals from existing employees (Best)
- Direct apply to company
- Recruiters on LinkedIN

### Resources

- Cracking the coding interviews
- GeeksforGeeks
- https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university
- Youtube (Freecodecamp/CSDojo)
- AlgoExpert / Algopro

### Interview important

- 45 mins sessions. (Like 4 sessions on same day)
- Optimal solution matters. Not garbage solution.
- Big O (Time & Space complexity)
- Coding
- System design / architecture / scalability
- Behavioural questions
- Practice a lot

### Coding

- Good var names
- Create helper methods(Avoid repeatetion)
- Short comments
- Ask clarifying questions
- Communication (Talk what you are thinking)
- Whiteboard / laptop

### Top 10 Algorithms

1. Depth first search
2. Breadth first search
3. Match Brackets
4. Hashtables
5. Variables/pointers manipulations
   - Quicksort & Mergesort are faster than Bubblesort
6. Reverse Linked list
7. Sort
8. Recursion (Rarely used in production because its a stack which has limits of iterations. Not sure.)
9. Custom Datastructures (Classes, OOPs)
10. Binary Search
