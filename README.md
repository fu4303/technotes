# Notes - Web Developer

I found out I was wasting too much time reading the same documents whenever I wanted a little help.

Like finding a _needle in a haystack_ and then throwing it back to find it again !

I decided to **Read, Collect, Analyze** and **Organise** all those needles for future reference without getting lost on www.

### My Approach

- Read topic to be good at it.
- Do some practicals.
- A quick research on topic.
- Break down to most simplistic form.
- Make notes.

### Pros

- Organised collection list of important topics.
- Avoids re-reading.
- Github search makes it powerful.
- More focus on core than the textual garbage.
- No more jargons which has multiple contextual meanings.
- Quick revision.
