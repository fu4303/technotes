  | ------------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
  | Linked Lists             | Breadth-First Search | Bit Manipulation        |
  | Trees, Tries, & Graphs   | Depth-First Search   | Memory (Stack vs. Heap) |
  | Stacks & Queues          | Binary Search        | Recursion               |
  | Heaps                    | Merge Sort           | Dynamic Programming     |

- **Powers of 2 / Memory limits / Scalability**

  | Powers of 2 | Exact value | Approx value | Memory |
  | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------ |
  | 7           | 128         | -            | -      |

  | 30          | -           | 1 billion    | 1 GB   |

- **Problem solving**
  1. Listen
  2. Example
     - Use numbers, strings.
     - NOT a special case.
  3. Brute force
  4. Optimize (**BUD**)
     - _Bottlenecks_ / _Unnecessary work_ / _Duplicated work_
     - How will it be in real world ? (searching in dictionary book is a binary search )
     - Try base case (like n=1)
     - Which data structure/algo is best ?
       <!-- - What is Best conceivable runtime )BCR)? - minimum needed to run. Can't go any lower. -->
  5. Walkthrough
  6. Implement
  7. Test
     - Small cases
     - Special & edge cases

## Offers and rejection

- **Deadline** - Company gives time of 1-4 weeks to reply for offer
- **Decline offer** - Say I think startup could be better for me. (Non-offensive).(Maybe after 1-2 years)
- **Rejection** - Reapply after some time. Ask for feedback if possible.

  - _Taxes_
  - _Stocks/equity_ (3-4 years)
