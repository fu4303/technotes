## # TDD - Test Driven Development

- *STEPS*
    - 1] Write a test case which the code fails to pass
    - 2] Design the new code
    - 3] Refactor code to pass test

### # UNIT TESTING - [PHPUnit]

- `Functions / methods / classes` are tested
- Pass input check output.
- Must pass test at anytime in dev life cycle
- Contributing to Github open source projects showing testing failed with proper solution.

### # INTEGRATED TESTING [PHPUnit]

- First Unit test is performed.
- Then the modules are integrated & tested.

### # FUNCTIONAL TESTING [Selenium, Codeception]

- Tools are used to create automated tests.
- These tests are like *real users* using the application.
- The business function is tested as a whole.

## # BDD - Behaviour Driven Development

- **SpecBDD** - Technical test `(PHPSpec)`
- **StoryBDD** - Business test `(Behat)`
